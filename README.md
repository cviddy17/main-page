## Summary

The initial sections of this repository will display code written in Python 3.6+
that can build data pipelines. This will be a work in progress, as there are
many forms data can take, however, I plan to make this a reference to encompass
as much of the data process as is available.

The final section will make a link to some of the other projects that I have
worked on and refined throughout my experiences as a Data Scientist.
